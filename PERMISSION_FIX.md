# 🔧 Permission Error Fixed!

## What Was Wrong

The error you encountered:

```
❌ Error requesting notification permission: Error: Exception in HostFunction:
Parameter specified as non-null is null: method com.zoontek.rnpermissions.RNPermissionsModule.check,
parameter permission
```

**Root Cause:**
The code was using `react-native-permissions` library incorrectly. The `PERMISSIONS.ANDROID.POST_NOTIFICATIONS` constant was either undefined or not properly imported, causing a null parameter error.

## What Was Fixed

✅ **Removed dependency on `react-native-permissions`**

- Now using React Native's built-in `PermissionsAndroid` API
- More reliable and doesn't require additional native configuration

✅ **Updated `requestUserPermission()` function**

- Uses `PermissionsAndroid.request()` for Android 13+
- Falls back to Firebase messaging permission
- Better error handling

✅ **Updated `checkNotificationPermission()` function**

- Uses `PermissionsAndroid.check()` for Android 13+
- Handles all Android versions correctly

## What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Reload Your App

Since you're using Metro bundler with Fast Refresh, just reload:

```bash
# In your terminal where Metro is running, press:
r  # to reload the app
```

Or in the app:

- Android: Press `R` twice quickly
- Or: Shake device → "Reload"

### Step 2: Check the Logs

You should now see:

```
🚀 Initializing FCM...
📱 Requesting notification permission...
📱 Platform: android
📱 Platform Version: 34 (or your Android version)
```

#### For Android 13+ (API 33+):

```
📱 Android 13+ detected, requesting POST_NOTIFICATIONS...
📱 Permission request result: granted
✅ POST_NOTIFICATIONS granted
```

#### For Android < 13:

```
📱 Firebase permission status: 1
✅ Notification permission granted: 1
```

### Step 3: Get Your FCM Token

Look for this in logs:

```
🔑 Requesting FCM token...
✅ FCM Token obtained successfully!
🔑 FCM Token: eNdK7abc123...xyz [LONG STRING]
```

**Copy this entire token!** You'll need it for testing.

### Step 4: Test Notifications

Now you have 3 ways to test:

#### Option A: Use the Debug Component (Easiest)

Add to any screen temporarily:

```javascript
import NotificationDebugger from '../components/NotificationDebugger';

// In your render:
<NotificationDebugger />;
```

Then:

1. Click "🧪 Test Notification" - Should work immediately
2. Click "3. Get FCM Token" - Copies token to clipboard

#### Option B: Test from Firebase Console

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/aivoxagency-2b9d1/
2. Navigate to: **Engage** → **Cloud Messaging**
3. Click: **"Send test message"**
4. Paste your FCM token
5. Send!

#### Option C: Use cURL Command

```bash
# Get your server key from Firebase Console → Settings → Cloud Messaging
SERVER_KEY="YOUR_FIREBASE_SERVER_KEY"
DEVICE_TOKEN="YOUR_DEVICE_FCM_TOKEN"

curl -X POST https://fcm.googleapis.com/fcm/send \
  -H "Authorization: key=$SERVER_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"to\": \"$DEVICE_TOKEN\",
    \"notification\": {
      \"title\": \"Test Notification\",
      \"body\": \"Testing from cURL!\",
      \"sound\": \"default\"
    },
    \"data\": {
      \"type\": \"new_order\",
      \"test\": true
    },
    \"priority\": \"high\"
  }"
```

## Expected Results After Fix

### ✅ Permission Request Should Work

When app starts, you should see a permission dialog (Android 13+):

```
BiteVendor needs to send you notifications for new orders and updates.

[Ask Me Later]  [Deny]  [Allow]
```

### ✅ FCM Token Should Be Generated

Console logs should show:

```
✅ FCM Token obtained successfully!
🔑 FCM Token: eNdK7abc... (150+ characters)
📤 Sending device token to backend...
✅ Device token sent successfully to backend
```

### ✅ Listeners Should Be Active

```
🔔 Setting up notification listeners...
📱 Notification listeners setup complete
✅ FCM initialization complete
```

## Common Issues After Fix

### Issue 1: Still Getting Permission Error

**Solution**: Make sure you fully reloaded the app

```bash
# Stop the app completely
# In Android Studio: Stop button
# Then restart:
npm run android
```

### Issue 2: No FCM Token

**Check your emulator:**

```bash
# Verify Google Play Services is installed
adb shell pm list packages | grep google.gms

# Should show: package:com.google.android.gms
```

**Solution**:

- Use emulator with **Google Play** (not just "Android")
- Or use a physical device

### Issue 3: Permission Dialog Doesn't Appear

**For Android 13+:**

- The permission dialog only appears once
- If you previously denied it, go to Settings → Apps → BiteVendor → Notifications
- Enable notifications manually

**For Android < 13:**

- Notifications are enabled by default
- No permission dialog needed

## Still Not Receiving Notifications from Backend?

If local tests work but backend notifications don't arrive:

### ⚠️ Firebase Project Mismatch

**Your current setup:**

- Project: `aivoxagency-2b9d1` (your personal Firebase)

**Backend likely uses:**

- Different Firebase project (ask backend team)

**Solution:**

1. Ask backend team for their Firebase config files:

   - `google-services.json` (Android)
   - `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS)

2. Replace your current files:

```bash
# Backup current files
mv android/app/google-services.json android/app/google-services.json.personal
mv ios/GoogleService-Info.plist ios/GoogleService-Info.plist.personal

# Add production files (from backend team)
# Then rebuild:
npm run android
```

## Cleanup (Optional)

Since we're no longer using `react-native-permissions`, you can optionally remove it:

```bash
npm uninstall react-native-permissions
```

But it's safe to leave it installed if other parts of your app might use it.

## Summary

✅ **Fixed:** Permission request error
✅ **Changed:** Now using React Native's built-in `PermissionsAndroid`
✅ **Next:** Reload app and test with debugger component

**The fix is ready - just reload your app and test!** 🚀
